# Red-Black Tree

This is my Red-Black Tree code written in Java for my fall Databases and Algoritms class. 

The Driver is currently set up to take user input and show your tree being made step by step, but also contains a test function to run 10 numbers immediately for troubleshooting.

This implementation uses the above template, where all rules are as usual but the roots children always turn to black if both are present. This avoids some future extra steps.
